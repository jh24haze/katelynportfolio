                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hi there! I'm Katelyn, a senior and soon-to-be graduate from Minnesota State University Moorhead with degrees in Multimedia Journalism (BS) and Film Production (BFA). I have a long-running passion for visual storytelling leading me to pursue these degrees and find something else I can share with others whether that be in videos or still photography.</p>

                <p>My mother is a professional photographer based out of Colorado Springs, Colorado, where I learned the basics of photography and how a camera works. In high school, I got to experiment with the video and journalistic side of the camera. With Rampart High School, I was able to submit work to state and national competitions. At both levels, I won awards from the Colorado Student Media Association and the Journalism Education Association. This led me to two wonderful internships with the Pikes Peak Business and Education Alliance (Summer 2020) and with Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota (Summer 2024).</p>

                <p>I currently work at the MSU Moorhead Wellness Center as the Marketing and Social Media Manager. I lead a team of students to create printed and digital content to go out to the student body for event awareness, health and wellness tips, and entertainment. I feel this position is a great mix of journalism, marketing, creativity, and teamwork that I look forward to every day.</p>
